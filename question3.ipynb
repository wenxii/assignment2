    "We know that credit limit and risk cause payments. We also think that email causes payments. As for `opened`, we think that it does cause payments. Intuitively, people that opened the collection email are more willing to negotiate and pay their debt. We also think that `opened` causes agreements for the same reasons as it causes payments. Moreover, we know `opened` is caused by email and we believe that people with different risk and credit limits have different open rates for the emails, so credit limit and risk also causes `opened`. As for agreement, we also think that it is caused by `opened`. Then we get following funnel:\n",

    "From the graph we can see that `opened` and `agreement` are both in the causal path from email to payments. So, if we control them in the regression, this is the effect of email while keeping `opened` and `agreement` fixed. However, both are part of the causal effect of the email, so they are not fixed. Instead, email increases payments precisely because it boosts the agreement rate. If those variables are fixed, some of the true effect from the email variable are omitted. \n",

That is because, if the treatment has a positive effect, those that didn't make an agreement even after having received the email are probably worse in terms of payments compared to those that also didn't do the agreement but also didn't get the extra incentive of the email. As for the second equation, those that did the agreement even without having received the treatment are probably better than those that did the agreement but had the extra incentive of the email. \n",
